I am passionate about harnessing data to drive informed decision-making. I am also interested in entrepreneurship and as a result I have recently co-founded a civil works consulting and civil works company called Viliso Holdings and I hope to start many more tech related business ideas in the future.

In my spare time I play the tenor saxophone for fun, play soccer for leisure and go to gym to keep active, young and healthy.

I am committed to continous improvement of my skills, knwoledge and experience which I hope to leverage on in my career and entrepreneurial journey.
